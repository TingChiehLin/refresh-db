# Create Better TV Show Search Experience

![Design TV Show Search Experience](./public/preview.png)

## Decision Making

I am generally doing from analysis, design inspiration to come out with ideas. After that, I read coding base and then improve more UX interaction and styling for the application.

- Think about who our customers? TV lovers? Children or Adults

- Analysis existing problems and Write down issues

- [Write down note in the Notion](https://www.notion.so/jaylinxr/Note-Improve-better-TV-Show-App-0ded821918104e7382ba424e27f58027)

- Design inspiration for wireframe, color and font for use

- Looking into code base and think about anythings, such as props, css3 and interaction what I am going to design

- Considering about resuable components in React

- Any animation to attract users? Click, Loading and hover experience

## Font Choice

I think users want to see TV show because they want to relax after works so I decided to use `Lato` which is popular as the same as `Roboto` or `Open Sans` for the challenge.

On the other hand, serif is used to appear more classic and serious so I did not choose.

## Color Choice

Green color represents nature. When everyone see to forest, I think the green color make them more comfortable feelings that reduce anxiety and stay calm.

- Primary: #53684D

- Secondary: #758245

- Hover/Interaction Effect: #E1D286

## letter-spacing

## Fix some issues with incapable version

I use Node version `18.3` so I have to adjust `react-start` to ` "start": "react-scripts --openssl-legacy-provider start"`

## Future Plan

- Add `aria-label` for disable people

- Consider about space, some of parts have extra space in order to improve UX

- I saw somethings I could make resualbel component for future use

- Scrollable area for `Cast members` if I had enough time due to too many members costing too much reading time

- I am trying to fix image resolution issues. As you can see, there are many different size in the details' page.
